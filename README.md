# Kaggle & Google — 5-Day Gen‑AI Intensive Course

Welcome to the repository of the **5‑Day Gen‑AI Intensive Course with Google**. This README contains an organized, copy‑ready version of the course overview, daily learning objectives, assignments, and initial setup instructions — formatted so you can paste it directly into a `README.md` on GitHub.

> This course is a 5‑day online program created by Google and Kaggle. It mixes conceptual deep dives (whitepapers & podcasts) with hands‑on Kaggle code labs so you can build Gen‑AI projects with confidence.

## 📘 Course Overview

Each day focuses on a core capability of modern generative AI systems and includes a livestream recording, short whitepaper, a NotebookLM podcast summary, and practical Kaggle code labs.

The five days cover:

* **Day 1 — Foundational LLMs & Text Generation**
* **Day 2 — Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases**
* **Day 3 — Generative AI Agents**
* **Day 4 — Domain‑Specific LLMs**
* **Day 5 — MLOps for Generative AI**

There is also a bonus notebook covering extra Gemini API features.

## 🚀 Initial Setup Instructions

Before you begin the code labs, complete the following steps:

1. **Create a Kaggle account** and learn how Notebooks work. Phone verification is required for the course labs.
2. **Create a Google AI Studio account** and ensure you can generate an API key (for Gemini API / Google GenAI integrations used in the labs).
3. **Join the Kaggle Discord** and the course channels (recommended):

   * `#5dgai-general-chat` — official announcements and livestream recordings
   * `#5dgai-introductions` — meet other participants
   * `#5dgai-q-and-a` — ask assignment questions and discuss code labs

**Resources & assignments:**

* Watch Day 3 livestream recording.
* Listen to the NotebookLM summary podcast for this unit.
* Read the whitepaper: *Generative AI Agents*.
* Complete these Kaggle code labs:

  * Talk to a database with function calling
  * Build an agentic ordering system in LangGraph

---

### Day 4 — Domain‑Specific LLMs

**What you’ll learn:** building and applying specialized LLMs (e.g., SecLM, MedLM), grounding models with live search results, and fine‑tuning (custom Gemini model) on labeled data.

**Resources & assignments:**

* Watch Day 4 livestream recording.
* Listen to the NotebookLM summary podcast for this unit.
* Read the whitepaper: *Solving Domain‑Specific Problems Using LLMs*.
* Complete these Kaggle code labs:

  * Use Google Search data to ground generation
  * Fine‑tune a Gemini model for a custom task

---

### Day 5 — MLOps for Generative AI

**What you’ll learn:** best practices for MLOps applied to generative systems, how to use Vertex AI tools (and related GCP resources) to scale, monitor, and deploy GenAI applications.

**Resources & assignments:**

* Watch Day 5 livestream recording.
* Listen to the NotebookLM summary podcast for this unit.
* Read the whitepaper: *MLOps for Generative AI*.
* Note: Day 5 focuses on demos and a code walkthrough rather than a new code lab. Review the provided repository and resources in advance.

## 🔎 Bonus Assignment

A bonus notebook demonstrates additional capabilities of the Gemini API that were not covered in the live sessions. This is optional but recommended if you want to explore more advanced features.

---

## ✅ Useful Tips for Course Success

* Make everything reproducible: upload datasets or provide clear instructions and seeds for reproducibility in Kaggle Notebooks.
* Use vector search (embeddings + FAISS / Milvus / Pinecone) for RAG workflows instead of naive keyword matching.
* Add clear prompt templates, test prompts, and an evaluation harness for each code lab.
* Document limitations and safety considerations (hallucination, data privacy, bias) in your writeups.

## 📦 How to Use This README

* Copy this `README.md` content directly into your GitHub repository to serve as the canonical course summary and project index.
* Replace placeholder links (livestream, whitepapers, code labs) with direct URLs from the course materials.
* Add a table of contents or day‑by‑day links to individual lab notebooks for convenience.

## License

Specify the license for your repo here (e.g., MIT, Apache‑2.0) — add a `LICENSE` file accordingly.

---

If you want, I can:

* Add a ready‑to‑paste Table of Contents with link placeholders for each livestream, whitepaper and lab, or
* Generate a full GitHub repository structure (folders + starter notebooks + `requirements.txt`) you can download.
